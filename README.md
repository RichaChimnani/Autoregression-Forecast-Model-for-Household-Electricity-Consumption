## Household Power Consumption Dataset

The Household Power Consumption dataset is a multivariate time series dataset that describes the electricity consumption for a single household over four years.
The data was collected between December 2006 and November 2010 and observations of power consumption within the household were collected every minute. It is a multivariate series comprised of seven variables (besides the date and time); they are:

global_active_power: The total active power consumed by the household (kilowatts).
global_reactive_power: The total reactive power consumed by the household (kilowatts).
voltage: Average voltage (volts).
global_intensity: Average current intensity (amps).
sub_metering_1: Active energy for kitchen (watt-hours of active energy).
sub_metering_2: Active energy for laundry (watt-hours of active energy).
sub_metering_3: Active energy for climate control systems (watt-hours of active energy).
